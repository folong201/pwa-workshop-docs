# What are Progressive Web Apps (PWA). The service worker API is the backbone of PWA functionality

Putting aside the marketing component of this popular term, let's look at the technical details: what exactly makes an application progressive and why PWA can be a new era in the development of the web.

- Prerequisites for the occurrence
- Formal definition
- Benefits for users and developers
- Opportunities and installation of a web application are the two main vectors of PWA development
- Current state of the art with support across platforms, operating systems, and browsers

Most of the capabilities of progressive web applications are implemented using the Service Worker API. To understand what exactly we will automate using Workbox, we will study the basic ideas of this API and write a service worker ourselves.

- Similarities and differences with other browser workers
- Service worker life cycle
- Main events
- Registration in the application
- Debugging in the browser
